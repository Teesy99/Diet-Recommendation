    <mat-card-title>What Causes Ulcers?</mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        Doctors used to think that certain foods could give you ulcers. 
        But now we know other things cause them, like taking pain-relieving drugs for a long time or infection with bacteria 
        called H. pylori.Although food doesnâ€™t cause or treat ulcers, some can make your pain worse, while others may help you heal faster.

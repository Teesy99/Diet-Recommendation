        <h3>Good foods to help your digestion</h3>
        <mat-card-content>
<p> A diet rich in fibre can help digestion and prevent constipation. Aim for the recommended dietary intake of 30g of fibre a day.</p>
<p>For a healthy bowel, you need fibre from a variety of sources,such as:<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more">
        <ul>
            <li>wholemeal bread</li>
            <li>brown rice</li>
            <li>fruit and veg</li>
            <li>beans</li>
            <li>oats</li>
          </ul>     
          <p>Some people find cereals and grains bring on bloating and irritable bowel syndrome. If that's the case, get your fibre from fruit and vegetables instead.</p>  
          <p>Fibre acts like a sponge, absorbing water. Without fluid, the fibre can't do its job and you'll get constipation.</p>
          <p>A good way to make sure you're getting enough fluids is to drink a glass of water with every meal. Avoid caffeine drinks as they can cause heartburn.</span></p>

        <h3>Green Bananas Help Relieve Diarrhea</h3>
        <mat-card-content>
<p>An upset stomach caused by an infection or food poisoning is often accompanied by diarrhea.</p>
<p>Interestingly, several studies have found that <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more2">giving cooked, green bananas to children with diarrhea can help reduce the amount, severity, and duration of episodes.
<p>In fact, one study found that the addition of cooked, green bananas was nearly four times more effective at eliminating diarrhea than a rice-based diet alone.</p>
<p>The powerful antidiarrheal effects of green bananas are due to a special type of fiber they contain known as resistant starch.</p>
<p>Resistant starch cannot be digested by humans, so it continues through the digestive tract all the way to the colon, the final portion of the intestines.</p>
<p>Once in the colon, it is slowly fermented by your gut bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids, which stimulate the bowels to absorb more water and firm up the stools.</span></p>

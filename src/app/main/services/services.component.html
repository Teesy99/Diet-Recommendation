    <h3>Beverages</h3>
<p>
        Beverages like milk, red wine, hot cocoa and tea are considered functional foods and should not be overlooked as a source of vital nutrients and antioxidants. Hot cocoa made with milk contains calcium and protein and helps ensure you get the recommended amount of milk each day, which most Americans fall short on.
